# A calculator with memory keys

Credit: A lot of ideas and code were found [here](https://jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v7usehxw/27/).

I modified each file, with additions, deletions, and changes. Of particular note, I:
   * Added the sign-value button (+-) and logic.
   * Added the MC, MR, and M+ buttons and logic.
   * Gave it a nice home on a desk with reordered buttons and a glass appearance.
